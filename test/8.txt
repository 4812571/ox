Hello there my name is Curlpipe and this is my text editor.

It runs very well because it's written in Rust and therefore 
memory issues that would initially be a problem are no longer 
a problem because Rust has an intriguing borrow checking system 
that very few / no other languages have.

Why not C?
C is a good language and I could have written Ox in
but due to Rusts better ecosystem in terms of dependency
management, potential, and safety, I chose Rust.

Why not C++?
(see C)
C++ is a total nightmare and I believe that it is an 
overly complicated languge and lacks a solution like 
cargo for managing packages

Why not Go?
Because Go is Slow and chunky.

Why not Python?
Because Python is slower than a reliant robin turning 
a corner at a speed at which it won't do a barrel roll 
and explode. (and thats about 1mph)
